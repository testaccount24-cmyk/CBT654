Running FSI

Before you run FSI you must first allocate the MLIB and PLIB
libraries to your TSO session.  You can use the following
commands:

alloc fi(fsimlib) da(fsi.v1r2m0.mlib) shr

alloc fi(fisplib) da(fsi.v1r2m0.plib) shr

Now you must give FSI access to the necessary load modules.  You
can do this two different ways.  First you can add the FSI load
library to your TSO Logon Procedure or you can allocate the FSI
Load Library data set to the DDNAME FSILLIB.

alloc fi(fisllib) da(fsi.v1r2m0.load) shr

If you added the FSI LOAD Library dataset to your LOGON PROC you
can invoke FSI directly as a TSO command:

READY

FSISTART SAMP01

If you use the FSILLIB method, you can use the TSO CALL command
to invoke FSI.

READY

call 'fsi.v1r0m0.load(fsistart)' 'samp01'

FSISTART will set up the environment and then attach the program
samp01 as a subtask.  FSISTART then waits for the subtask to end.
