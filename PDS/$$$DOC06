Specifying Messages


Specifying Messages

FSI messages are defined in the MLIB data set.  Each member in
the MLIB can define one or more messages.  The name of the member
in the MLIB is the message ID minus the last character.  For
example MLIB member "SAMP010" will contain messages SAMP0101,
SAMP0102, SAMP010A, etc.

 SAMP0101 'INVALID USERID ENTERED'
 SAMP0102 'HINT: USE ANYTHING FOR THE USERID'
 SAMP0103 'INVALID PASSWORD ENTERED'
 SAMP0104 'HINT: TRY USING ''SECRET'' FOR THE PASSWORD'
 SAMP0105 'HINT: TRY USING ''END'' FOR A COMMAND'
